            <P>
                Thank you for all the sacrifices you make for our family and
                all the joy and love you bring into our lives.
                We couldn’t have asked for a better Dad! Happy Father’s day.
                Thank you for working as hard as you do every day to provide for us.
                You always make time for me when you’re home from work
                and I love hanging out with you. I hope you have a fabulous Father’s day.

            </P>
